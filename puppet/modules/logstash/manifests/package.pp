# = Class: logstash::package
#
# Class to manage where we get the logstash jar from
#
# == Parameters:
#
# $logstash_version::   description of parameter. default value if any.
# $logstash_provider::   description of parameter. default value if any.
# $logstash_home::   description of parameter. default value if any.
# $logstash_baseurl:: Where to curl the jar file from if http is used
# defaults to http://semicomplete.com/files/logstash/
# $java_package::   description of parameter. default value if any.
#
# == Actions:
#
# Makes sure that a logstash jar is available, via http, puppet or package
#
# == Requires:
#
# $logstash_provider='http' is the simplest and most tested method,
# it just curl's the file into place, so you need internet access,
# unless you have mirror'd the file locally
#
# == Sample Usage:
#
# == Todo:
#
# * Add better support for other ways providing the jar file?
